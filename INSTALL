Build & install instructions
============================

 These are build & install instructions for Fleeting Password Manager.

Build dependencies
------------------

 Fleetingpm uses CMake as the build system. There's also fleetingpm.pro
 for qmake, configured to build against Qt5. It doesn't have install
 targets so the Linux packaging should use CMake.

 Both Qt4 and Qt5 are supported, and Qt4 is used by default.

 Qt5 can be enabled by passing -DUseQt5=1 to cmake or to
 the configure script.

 Fleetingpm also exploits some features of the C++11
 standard, so a compliant compiler is required (GCC >= 4.6).

Building in the command line on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 12.04)
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Development build (the game can be run without installing anything):

 1) Install Qt4 development files (libqt4-dev on Ubuntu).
 2) Install CMake.
 3) Go to the source directory and run:

 $ ./configure

 This runs CMake that generates the makefiles.
 You can also run cmake directly. The configure script
 is only for convenience and is just a wrapper for cmake. 

 If everything went ok, run:
  
 $ make

 Run the application:

 $ ./fleetingpm

 Install the binaries and data files:

 $ sudo make install

 This install also the desktop files so fleetingpm
 should appear in your application menu.

Release builds for Windows
--------------------------

 Release builds for Windows are currently done with
 MXE (www.mxe.cc) cross-compilation environment on Linux. 

 See scripts/mxeEnv.sh and scripts/mxeWindowsBuild.
