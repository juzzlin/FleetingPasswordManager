Build & install instructions
============================

 These are build & install instructions for Fleeting Password Manager.

Build dependencies
------------------

 Fleetingpm uses CMake as the build system. There's also fleetingpm.pro
 for qmake, configured to build against Qt5. It doesn't have install
 targets so the Linux packaging should use CMake.

 Fleetingpm also exploits some features of the C++11
 standard, so a compliant compiler is required (GCC >= 4.6).

Building in the command line on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 16.04)
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Development build (the game can be run without installing anything):

 1) Install Qt5 development files (ubuntu-sdk package on Ubuntu)
 2) Install CMake
 3) Go to the source directory and run:

 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ..

 If everything went ok, run:
  
 $ make

 Run the application:

 $ ./fleetingpm

 Install the binaries and data files:

 $ sudo make install

 This install also the desktop files so fleetingpm
 should appear in your application menu.

Release builds for Windows
--------------------------

 Release builds for Windows are currently done with
 MXE (www.mxe.cc) cross-compilation environment on Linux. 

 See scripts/mxeEnv.sh and scripts/mxeWindowsBuild.
