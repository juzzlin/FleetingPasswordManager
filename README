README for Fleeting Password Manager
====================================

Fleeting Password Manager is a simple program that generates highly secure
pseudo-random passwords from the given <b>master password, URL/ID
(e.g. facebook, www.facebook.com, google, my_server..) and user name.
The user needs to remember only her master password to recover other passwords.

Passwords are always regenerated on-the-fly from the given login data when needed
and are never saved. In other words, Fleeting Password Manager combines
the password creation and management.

The length of the generated password is configurable between 8 and 32 characters
and Fleeting Password Manager can remember wanted URL/User-pairs.
